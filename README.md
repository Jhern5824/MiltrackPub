## Problem Statement

CyberReq seeks to address the problem of talent management across each service branchâ€™s Cyber corps. CyberReq aims to consolidate Cyber talent across all service branches into a single portal. Servicemembers can then consistently and periodically update the CyberReq portal with their talents, skill sets, specializations and education, and mission owners (Commanders, flight chiefs, team leaders) can then use the CyberReq portal to properly search for the best and brightest talent across the military and scout those servicemembers to fulfill the mission need.
